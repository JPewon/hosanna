'And if ye be Christ\'s, then are ye Abraham\'s seed, and heirs according to the promise (Galatians 3:29).'
'\n\nOur theme verse says if you belong to Christ, then you’re Abraham’s seed and an heir according to the promise. This is so profound. It also brings to mind what the Apostle Paul said in Ephesians 1:3, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.”'
'\n\nYou\'ve already been blessed with "ALL" spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. You’re an heir of a Kingdom of blessings. This just takes the struggle out of life. Think about the Master’s gratifying words in Luke 12:32 (NKJV), “Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” Why would anyone know this and struggle in life? Then, to think He’s even done it already makes it super transcendent. He’s already given you the Kingdom.'
'\n\nI’m an heir of God’s Kingdom of blessings; divine life, health, prosperity, success, joy, peace and victory are mine in Christ. I’m blessed and I live in superabundance because I’m the seed of Abraham. I thank you Lord, for the Kingdom belongs to me; therefore, I have all things that pertain to life and godliness, and I flourish exceedingly in every good work, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.'
